Web Extraction with Langchain & OpenAI
Utilize the power of the langchain web extraction library in tandem with OpenAI's GPT models to effortlessly extract product details from WooCommerce websites.

🚀 Getting Started
🛠️ Prerequisites
Python: The script is compatible with Python 3.x.
pip: To manage the Python packages, ensure pip is installed.
🔧 Installation
Virtual Environment: Before we proceed, it's recommended to set up a Python virtual environment to keep things clean and organized.

First, if you haven't already, install virtualenv:

bash
Copy code
pip install virtualenv
Navigate to your project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/directory
Create a new virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
virtualenv venv
Activate it:

On Windows:

bash
Copy code
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS and Linux:

bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install Necessary Libraries: With your virtual environment activated, install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install beautifulsoup4 lxml openai langchain
📜 Running the Script
API Key Setup: Before executing, ensure you've added your OpenAI API key in the openai_api_key variable inside the script.

Execution:

Navigate (if you haven't already) to the script's directory:

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/script/directory
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python script_name.py
📌 Don't forget to replace script_name.py with your actual script's name.

Results: If all goes well, the product details will be saved in a file named new.csv.

🧹 Cleanup
Once done, it's a good practice to deactivate your virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
deactivate
