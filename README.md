Web Extraction with Langchain and OpenAI


This script allows you to extract product details from a WooCommerce website using the langchain web extraction library and OpenAI's GPT models.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python: This script requires Python 3.x.

pip: Ensure that you have pip installed, which is the package installer for Python.

Setting up a Virtual Environment
It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to avoid any conflicts with other Python projects. Here's how you can set it up:

Install virtualenv if you haven't:

bash
Copy code
pip install virtualenv
Navigate to your project directory or where you have the script and set up a new virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
virtualenv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

Windows:

bash
Copy code
.\venv\Scripts\activate
macOS and Linux:

bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Installing the Libraries
With the virtual environment activated, install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install beautifulsoup4 lxml openai

bash
Copy code
pip install langchain
Running the Script
Ensure that you have an API key for OpenAI's GPT models. Update the openai_api_key in the script with your key.

Navigate to the directory where your script is located using your terminal or command prompt.

Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python script_name.py
Replace script_name.py with the name you've given to your script.

If everything is set up correctly, the script should execute and save the extracted product details to new.csv.

Deactivating the Virtual Environment
Once you're done, you can deactivate the virtual environment by simply typing:

bash
Copy code
deactivate
